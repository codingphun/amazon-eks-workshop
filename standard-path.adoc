== Workshop Cleanup

Once you have finished with the workshop, please don't forget to spin down your cluster or you will incur additional charges.
(We will also remind you at the end!)

==== Delete Kubernetes cluster resources

In your Cloud9 IDE, check if there are any running kubernetes cluster

   $ kops get cluster

Delete kubernetes cluster

   $ kops delete cluster example.cluster.k8s.local --yes

Wait until all resources are deleted by kops

==== Delete Cloud9 Envionment

Go to CloudFormation console, right click template with name 'k8s-workshop' and select 'Delete Stack'

This should delete all the resources associated with this workshop

NOTE: You will incur charges as you go through these workshop guides as it will exceed the link:http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-limits.html[limits of AWS free tier]. An estimate of charges (<$20/day) can be seen at this link:https://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#r=FRA&s=EC2&key=calc-E6DBD6F1-C45D-4827-93F8-D9B18C5994B0[simple monthly calculator]
